# mod12_reading_best_companies

This is a liitle project where I need it to use package BeautifulSoap to read a page in HTML, then manke a brief study using Pandas.

The main point of this code is gather the data from the HTML page, and create an archive in CSV.

After that, apply pandas to make a DataFrame, and create another CSV file with a better clean data.
